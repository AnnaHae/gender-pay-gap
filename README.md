## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand the differences between female and male developers:

1. Whats the difference in income of professional female and male developers?
2. What was the difference in income in the past years?
3. How is salary distributed in terms of professional coding experience?
4. Is there a gender bias in female and male incomes?
 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 4 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to explain the individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@annatrumm/how-tech-makes-women-close-the-gender-pay-gap-2b306de4b965?sk=61e0c51593b98564e5805ad02f2eafcc).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2020/data).
For the boostrap analysis the basic function from Datacamps Statistical Thinking with Python Part 2 was used and changed to meet my requirements.
Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like! 1
